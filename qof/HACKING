Replacement of lib/libsql
-------------------------

The code in lib/libsql came from the libgda package
at about v1.0.3 and is now commonly available, including
on Mac OSX via fink - albeit at only v1.0.4-3.

Fedora Core 3 has 1.0.4, Fedora Core 4 has 1.2.0 and Debian
has 1.2.1-2.

Therefore, libgda will be used wherever possible and lib/libsql
will eventually be dropped.

This also helps complete the CashUtil project that will need the
SQL handling in QOF and GnuCash itself which is likely to use more
SQL directly in the future.
