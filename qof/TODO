For a full list of TODO items, see the Doxygen output in
the documentation package: doxy/todo.html

Typically installed into 
/usr/share/doc/libqof-doc/html/doxy/todo.html
or similar, depending on your distribution.

Also take a look at doxy/deprecated.html which
describes all the functions, objects, values and
types that need to be replaced in code using QOF
to make the transition to libqof2.

QofTime/QofDate in QSF

QSF still supports both <date> and <time> when built
with deprecated code enabled (the default). Applications
should convert existing files from <date> to <time>.
Each file would then only need to be read once with this
option set.
