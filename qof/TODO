For a full list of TODO items, see the Doxygen output in
the documentation package: doxy/todo.html

** PROBLEM ** Conversion now fixed but very slow
because begin and commit are being called during
session copy operations. Need to bypass.

Typically installed into 
/usr/share/doc/libqof-doc/html/doxy/todo.html
or similar, depending on your distribution.

Also take a look at doxy/deprecated.html which
describes all the functions, objects, values and
types that need to be replaced in code using QOF
to make the transition to libqof2.

LDFLAGS issue:
 Should be able to use -Wl,-z,defs but hangovers in
libqofsql mean that some functions need to be deprecated
and missing symbols removed. Not a major issue because
no extraneous dependencies are caused, AFAICT.

This is part of the libgda2 mess - qof only needs to
link against /usr/lib/libgdasql.so.3.0.0 but this is not
exposed directly via pkgconfig. /usr/lib/libgda-2.so.3.0.0
is linked against libgdasql so linking qof against libgda-2
allows the missing symbols (from qof/qofsql.c) to be
resolved. Not ideal.

QofTime/QofDate in QSF

QSF still supports both <date> and <time> when built
with deprecated code enabled (the default). Applications
should convert existing files from <date> to <time>.
Each file would then only need to be read once with this
option set.
