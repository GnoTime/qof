There are fivee examples in this directory, showing how to use
QOF for queries.  One example shows how to use the raw, c-language
query-construction programming interface, the other shows how to
use an SQL-like language that is parsed and executed on the client 
side.  The two programs are both nearly identical; they both perform
a query over a collection of instances of "MyObject".

The "sql-example" program provides an example of the client-side 
SQL query parsing and execution.

The "query-example" program provides an example of the usage of
the low-level query-construction routines.

The "gobject" subdirectory contains example code showing how to use 
QOF to perform a query over GObjects.

The "backend" subdirectory contains example code showing how a QOF
object can use the DWI backend to save and restore itself from
an SQL database.
