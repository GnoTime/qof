QOF-generator: http://qof-gen.sourceforge.net/

Updated June 2005 Neil Williams <linux@codehelp.co.uk>

These examples are becoming obsolete. The QOF-generator
project will replace each one. Also, letting the gobject
examples build automatically introduced a spurious build
dependency on Gtk+ when QOF has no inherent GUI requirements.

The examples will be retained in CVS only.

QOF-generator builds real examples based on your own parameters,
structures and requirements. Please use QOF-generator for future
examples, test code and as a base for production code using QOF.

------------

There are four examples in this directory, showing how to use
QOF for queries.  One example shows how to use the raw, C-language
query-construction programming interface, the other shows how to
use an SQL-like language that is parsed and executed on the client 
side.  The two programs are both nearly identical; they both perform
a query over a collection of instances of "MyObject".

The "sql-example" program provides an example of the client-side 
SQL query parsing and execution.

The "query-example" program provides an example of the usage of
the low-level query-construction routines.

The "gobject" subdirectory contains example code showing how to use 
QOF to perform a query over GObjects.

The "backend" subdirectory contains example code showing how a QOF
object can use the DWI backend to save and restore itself from
an SQL database.
