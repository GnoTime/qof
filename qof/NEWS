August 2006: The SQLite backend for embedded systems 
	is now working.
	The gnc-numeric to QofNumeric transition is 
	complete.
	Other bugfixes in 0.7.1 :
	QofDate and QofTime fixes to avoid using GDate except in explicit
		conversions (prevents build failures on hppa and sparc).
	Fix the QSF valgrind patch to avoid seg fault on writing QSF.
	Both these patches are already in the Debian package, 0.7.0-2.

July 2006: Implemented QofTime and QofDate throughout
	the rest of the library. Enabled configure option
	to build without deprecated code in preparation
	for libqof1 on embedded systems and for libqof2
	more generally: --disable-deprecated-qof

June 2006: Replaced gnc-date with QofTime and a new
	QofDate, splitting time handling (seconds) from
	date handling (calendar). Full 64bit support
	for all times and dates within a couple dozen
	times the age of the universe. Handlers to convert
	to limited types like struct tm, time_t and GDate
	when within range.

May 2006: Support for undo operations with each QofBook
	added. Beginning overhaul of gnc-date to QofTime.
	Add support from coreutils in Debian to support
	nanosecond time formats.
	Add automated build of Doxygen documentation to
	provide a doc package (Toshio's idea.)

April 2006:
	Add encoding backend option to allow QSF to
	be written out using a different locale.
	Improved map handling.
	Replace gnc-engine-util with qofutil.
	Move the function versions of the begin_edit 
	and commit_edit routines to the new Utilities 
	file alongside the macro versions from 
	qof-be-utils.h

March 2006: Support iteration over incoming QSF objects 
	inside map operations.
	Skip unregistered objects when processing maps.
	Correct map handling to allow reverse operations and 
	iteration over hierarchical objects. Improving debug 
	messages and preventing a crash when loading a map 
	directly.
	David Hampton's patches to allow users to skip 
	deprecated code in libqof1 and to remove use of 
	config.h in a header.
	qof_book_merge replaced with qofbookmerge, structures
	and functions renamed according to libqof2 convention.
	Deprecated old versions and use new calls inside library.
	Standardise on gint and gchar.

February 2006: Replaced gnc-event.* with qofevent files,
	in line with naming conventions for libqof2.
	Corrected QOF_TYPE_COLLECT handling including
	references and new files: qofreference.c|.h
	Add error handler for files that cannot be opened.
	Derek Atkin's patch to improve error handler removal.
	Deprecating qof_log_set_level_global due to 
	misleading name.
	Derek Atkin's fixes for reciprocal numeric handling.

January 2006: Backend loader now less reliant on .la 
	files - still recommended. Added deprecated.c to
	preserve deprecated function names into the binary.

November 2005: Preparing 0.6.1 - 64bit patch for qofgobj.c,
	Fixed the INSERT handler to accept more than one value.
	Fixed the FSF addresses in each file.
  QOF for embedded systems support.

October 2005: Preparing for libqof1 final release and outlining
    how QOF will change in the future.

May 2005 : Tidying up calls to create a usable distribution 
     for packaging.

March 2005 : Partial book support to make import/export
     a lot easier.

January 2005 : Add support for a generic XML backend - QSF.

August 2004 : add support for merging QofBook structures with
     collision handling.

April 2004 : make the documentation look much nicer by using doxygen
     markup correctly.

June 27 2003 : rename many files and functions to use qof prefix, and 
     to use a gnome style naming convention.

June 16 2003 : Initial split-off from gnucash
