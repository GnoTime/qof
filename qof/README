                QOF - Query Object Framework
                ----------------------------

Please see the NEWS file and the ChangeLog for detailed
information on changes since 0.6.0.

Documentation:
--------------
The QOF documentation is entirely embedded in the source code. You
can build an html version of the documentation by installing the
'doxygen' package, and then 'cd doc; make doc'.  Skim the doc/README
file for more info.

Linking/Building
----------------
This version of QOF uses the 'pkg' system of managing include files
and libraries.  To compile and link your program against QOF, see the
example in the HACKING file.
