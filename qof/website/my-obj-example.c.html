<div><p>The example below shows how to perform an SQL query over 
a collection of generic, programmer-defined objects. The example 
comes in two parts:  first, the definition of a generic object, and 
second, the actual 'application program' that queries over the set of 
objects.</p>

<h2>Defining a Queriable Object</h2>
<div><p>QOF provides a loose run-time typed object system.  To make
an object queriable, you must use that system.  However, it is our 
hope that the system is sufficiently loose that it doesn't impose 
any undesired, forced structure on your particular programming style.  
We are trying to provide mechanism, not policy.  Note that this 
example is in C not C++.</p>
</div>

<div><p>
QOF has only two dependencies, and those are 
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/glib/">GLib</a> and
libxml2.</p>
<p>GLib is a collection of basic algorithms and structures 
for C programmers, such as linked lists, hash tables, 
and more.  Glib is a fairly small, fast and simple system, 
and should not present difficulties to the experienced
programmer.  In the example below, the list of results
from the query are returned as a linked list of GLib 
objects.  Please note that this example neither uses
nor requires GObjects or Gtk+ in any way.</p>

/** @file my-object.c
 *   @brief Example definition of a queriable object. 
 *  @author Copyright (c) 2003,2004 Linas Vepstas &lt;linas@linas.org&gt;
 *
 *  This example program shows how to configure an arbitrary
 *  programmer-defined oject "MyObj" so that the Query routines
 *  can be used on it.  It shows one part of the total:
 *  -- The object definition, showing how to hook into the query system.
 *
 * Please make note of how the 'book' is used.  A 'book' can serve
 * as a collection of collections.  In the example below, the book
 * will be used to hold all of the instances of 'my object' so that
 * these can be found later.  Note that the book doesn't need to 
 * exclusively hold only instances of 'my object', it can hold 
 * collections of other types as well. 
 *
 * The above ability is one reason why 'book' holds such a central
 * place in the QOF system.  Note also: when the query is performed
 * over all instances of 'my object', its not really over *all* 
 * instances; its only over those instances stored in the given book.
 * Thus, the book is a kind of dataset, and by using books, one
 * can have multiple disjoint datasets.

<h2>The Main Application Program</h2>
The above defined a C object.  Below follows an application program that
shows how to perform SQL queries over a collection of these objects.

 *  @breif Example program showing SQL to perform query over objects.
 *  @author Copyright (c) 2003, 2004 Linas Vepstas &lt;linas@linas.org&gt;
 *
 *  This example program shows how to configure an arbitrary
 *  programmer-defined oject "MyObj" so that the Query routines
 *  can be used on it.  It consists of four basic peices:
 *  -- The object definition, showing how to hook into the query system.
 *     (this part is in the "my-object.c" file)
 *  -- Generic application intialization, including the creation of
 *     a number of instances of MyObj.
 *  -- QOF intialization, required before QOF can be used.
 *  -- The definition and running of a query, and a printout of the
 *     results.
