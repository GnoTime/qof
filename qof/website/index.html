<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<div><p>QOF, the Query Object Framework, provides a set of C Language utilities 
for performing generic structured complex queries on a set of data held by a set of
C/C++ objects. This framework is unique in that it does NOT require SQL or any
database at all to perform the query. Thus, it allows programmers to add query
support to their applications without having to hook into an SQL Database.</p>
<p>Typically, if you have an app, and you want to add the ability to show a set of
reports, you will need the ability to perform queries in order to get the data
you need to show a report.  Of course, you can always write a set of ad-hoc
subroutines to return the data that you need. But this kind of a programming
style is not extensible: just wait till you get a user who wants a slightly
different report.</p>
<p>The idea behind QOF is to provide a generic framework so that
any query can be executed, including queries designed by the end-user.
Normally, this is possible only if you use a database that supports SQL, and
then only if you deeply embed the database into your application. QOF provides
simpler, more natural way to work with objects.</p>

<h2 id="example">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="generate">Generating examples of your own</h3>
<div><a href="http://qof-gen.sourceforge.net/">
<img src="sflogosm.png" alt="qof-gen at SourceForge" id="sflogosm">
</a></div>
<div>Writing new QOF objects and examples can be a tad repetitive so
<a href="http://qof-gen.sourceforge.net/">QOF generator</a>
automates the process using HTML forms and PHP. The generator is still new but
it does create usable C code and an example program that can be compiled against
current QOF CVS.
</div>
<h3 id="online">Online examples</h3>
<div><p>Several usage examples are also provided with the source code.  Most
notable are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="my-obj-example.c.html">example of using QOF
to perform a query over some user-defined objects</a>. This example shows 
how to define an object in QOF, and then perform a half-dozen different SQL 
queries on it.</li>
<li>An <a href="gobj-example.c.html">example of using QOF to query a set 
of GLib GObjects</a>.  This particular example creates three GtkButton widgets, 
sets their labels to different values, and then uses the statement
<code>"SELECT * FROM GtkButton WHERE (label = 'asdfasdf');"</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr><h2 id="docs">Documentation</h2>
<div><p>The API documentation is embedded in the header files and
<a href="doxy/index.html">can be viewed as HMTL</a>
once built using doxygen:
<br/><code>cd doc/<br/>make doc<br/></code></p>
<p>There is also documentation of the
<a href="http://code.neil.williamsleesmill.me.uk/">book merge</a>
and the <a href="http://code.neil.williamsleesmill.me.uk/qsf.html">XML
backend</a> designs.</p>

</div>
<hr><h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<div><p>QOF is an offshoot from the <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">GnuCash
Project</a>, where this framework is a deep, central component. QOF is basically
the GnuCash "engine" with all of the financial objects removed. As such, QOF is
"tried and true", and has proven its worth. However, this SourceForge project is
listed as "alpha" because much work remains to be done, including the expanded
support for SQL backends, scheme wrappers, and many other features. Currently,
the QOF code is kept manually in sync with the GnuCash code; at some future
date, the QOF core will be removed from GnuCash.</p>
</div>
<hr><h2 id="functions">Function</h2>
<div><p>Besides the query framework, QOF also provides a number of other
base functions from GnuCash:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Universally-Unique 128-bit identifiers</b>.
These can be used to reference an object without having to have a pointer to it:
references can be stored in files, passed over the net, etc.</li>
<li><b>Persistent-Storage backend</b>.
A collection of objects can be associated with a particular data store. Besides
just reading from and writing to the backend, queries can be passed to the
backend, so that if a particular object does not exist locally, it can be
fetched from the backend.</li>
<li><b>Key-Value Pair trees</b> (also known as "frames and slots").
KVP trees provide a generic, extensible way to hang additional data onto an
object.  The trees store the data hierarchically, in a set of hash tables, and
can be accessed using a URL-like path name. KVP trees are a great way to allow
objects to be extensible.</li>
<li><b>Trace Utilities</b>
Allow warning, error and debugging messages to be enabled or disabled at
run-time, thus allowing individual components of an application to be
individually traced.</li>
<li><b>Numeric support</b>
Provides a set of exact-math functions for quantities that can be expressed as
ratios.  In particular, this is handy for working with money and prices, where
round-off errors need to be eliminated and/or precisely controlled.</li>
<li><b>Date and time utilities</b>.
A variety of different utilities for parsing and printing dates and time.</li>
<li><b>Generic XML format</b>
For data interchange. QOF objects can be translated and mapped between
applications, liberating the user's data from the original application.</li>
<li><b>Book merging</b>
Allows easy import / export of QOF data and handles collisions and user
intervention.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals">Project Goals</h2>
<div><p>Below are some concrete project goals.
See <a href="why-qof.html">"Why QOF?"</a> for the more abstract ideas behind
QOF, including the relationships between "database-driven", "program-driven"
and "data-centric" programming explored at
<a href="http://www.data-freedom.org/explain.html">Data-Freedom.org</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p> Provide an object framework that allows programmers to create expressive
queries that will search through a collection of objects, returning the desired
set of objects.</p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Completed, in that queries can be built and run.  Queries can be
built with either a low-level C API, or by writing in an SQL-like language (for
example, <tt>SELECT memo FROM gncTransaction WHERE
gncTransaction.date='15.06.2003';</tt>).  This is done with a "client-side"
parser, that parses this SQL locally, because, of course, it has to be run
locally.  See the <tt>sql-example.c</tt> file for a usage example. </p>
</li>
<li><p> Provide integration with database backends.  In particular, the programmer
should be able to use QOF to create a local 'cache' of objects that mirrors a
subset of the contents in a remote database.  The idea is that applications, by
working with a local copy, can be highly responsive and have good performance.
On the other hand, by working with only a subset of the remote data, the
application can avoid having a huge memory footprint. This is a very unique
feature: most applications take an all-or-nothing approach, where either all of
the data is sucked into the application, or none is.  Applications that pull in
all of the data have terrible startup times, since they need to load either a
huge file or make a huge database query. They also use a huge amount of memory.
Applications that pull in none of their data, and instead issue SQL queries as
needed, tend to have terrible performance profiles, since the user must wait for
the query to complete and return data.  In other words, QOF provides
scalability: instead of the all-or-nothing approach, it provides a middle
ground, allowing small fast apps to access huge databases. </p>
<p> <b>Status:</b> The GnuCash backend provides access to file and to SQL
storage.  However, not all of this code has been abstracted out in a generic way
to be brought back into QOF.  Linas has got the major pieces ready to go, in the
DWI project, but they're not integrated yet. Neil has added support for partial
books that make this cache possible and merging that makes the data in the
partial books accessible. Partial books also make it simple to export an
arbitrary selection of objects and entities.
</p></li>
<li><p> The current 'client-side' SQL engine is rather basic in its features and
performance.  For example, the current search over object fields is O(N),
because each object instance is checked for a match.  It would be nice to add
support for 'primary keys' and/or indexes as the first step towards a query
optimizer.  Alternately (or in addition), a different query engine might be
wedged into place. For example, sqllite might make for an excellent client-side
sql engine: its small fast and optimized. </p></li>
<li><p> Provide for off-line operation.  Because the object data is cached locally,
users should be able to continue doing useful work even if they are not attached
to the net.  When they regain net access, QOF should be able to resynchronize
with the remote servers. </p>
<p><b>Status:</b> Implemented as XML. Any book (partial or complete) can be 
written out to XML and read back in to <b>any</b> QOF application.
</p></li>
<li><p> Provide memory-management facilities. If objects in the local object 
cache haven't been used in a while, and the application memory usage is getting 
too large, the unused objects should be "reaped" or garbage-collected.  Of course,
this can be done only if the object is fully in sync with the persistent storage
backend. </p>
<p>Status: just an idea, not started.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="status">Project Status</h2>
<div>
<p>This code is in active, daily use in
<a href="http://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash</a>, and when used there, it is
'stable' code.  However, the code in this CVS tree is under development,
is lacking in certain desired features, and might not compile. Neil is adding
documentation wherever and whenever possible and QOF generator will provide
all the examples. The subroutine naming convention is being resolved by
deprecating older GnuCash-specific naming conventions.</p>
