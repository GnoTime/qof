<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>
    Provide an object framework that allows programmers to create
    expressive queries that will search through a collection of 
    objects, returning the desired set of objects.
    </p>
<li><p>
    Provide integration with database backends.  In particular, the
    programmer should be able to use QOF to create a local 'cache'
    of objects that mirrors a subset of the contents in a remote
    database.  The idea is that applications, by working with a local
    copy, can be highly responsive and have good performance.  On
    the other hand, by working with only a subset of the remote data,
    the application can avoid having a huge memory footprint.  
    This is a very unique feature: most applications take an
    all-or-nothing approach, where either all of the data is sucked
    into the application, or none is.  Applications that pull in
    all of the data have terrible startup times, since they need to
    load either a huge file or make a huge database query. They also
    use a huge amount of memory.  Applications that pull in none of
    thier data, and instead issue SQL queries as needed, tend to have
    terrible performance profiles, since the user must wait for the 
    query to complete and return data.  In otherwords, QOF provides 
    scalability: instead of the all-or-nothing approach, it provides
    a middle ground, allowing small fast apps to access huge databases.
    </p>
    <p>
    Status: The GnuCash backend provides access to file and to SQL
    storage.  However, none of this code has been abstracted out in 
    a generic way, and hasn't been brought back into QOF.
    </p>
<li><p>
    Provide for off-line operation.  Because the object data is cached
    locally, users should be able to continue doing useful work even
    if they are not attached to the net.  When they regain net access, 
    QOF should be able to resynchronize with the remote servers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Status: just an idea, not started.
    </p>
<li><p>
    Provide memory-mangement facilities. If objects in the local 
    object cache haven't been used in a while, and the application
    memory usage is getting too large, the unused objects should 
    be "reaped" or garbage-collected.  Of course, this can be done
    only if the object is fully in sync with the persistant storage
    backend.
    </p>
    <p>
    Status: just an idea, not started.
    </p>
</ul>


<h2>Project Status</h2>
This code is in active, daily use in 
<a href="http://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash</a>, and when used there, it is
'stable' code.  However, the code in this CVS tree is under development, 
is lacking in certain desired features, and might not compile. It lacks
adequate documentation.  It lacks examples.  It lacks a snazzy webpage.
<p>
The only other project currently using QOF is 
<a href="http://gnotime.sourceforge.net">GnoTime</a>.
