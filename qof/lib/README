          Prerequisite and Extension Libraries
          ------------------------------------

This directory contains code that is needed by QOF,
but is either not available on all platforms or needs
to be extended from the "default" version.

Contents:
---------
The libsql directory contains code copied from the
libgda (http://www.gnome-db.org/) Gnome database system.

LibGDA support
--------------
The libsql directory is not built if libgda >= 1.2.0 can be
found on the build system. (August 2005). Note: libgda support
is *limited* to the STABLE libgda releases. v1.3 and 1.9 are
NOT detected by QOF and should not be used. Patches to support
the unstable libgda code will be refused. If a stable libgda
is not available on your platform, let QOF use the internal code
in lib/libsql instead.
