          Pre-Requesit Libraries
          ----------------------

This directory contains code that is needed by QOF,
code that is normally 'external' to QOF, but
is not generally available as a library or installable
package.  Thus, the code has been copied here so as to
simplify the build and installation of QOF.  If/when 
such libraries become commonly available through 'well-known'
installable packages, then it should be removed from here.

Contents:
---------
The libsql directory contains code copied from the
libgda (http://www.gnome-db.org/) Gnome database system.

The dwi directory contains code copied from the DWI
project (http://dwi.sourceforge.net)

LibGDA support
--------------
The libsql directory is not built if libgda >= 1.2.0 can be
found on the build system. (August 2005).
