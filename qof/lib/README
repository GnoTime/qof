This directory contains code that is needed by QOF,
code that is normally 'external' to QOF, but
is not generally available as a library.  Thus, the
code has been copied into QOF until such time 
that this is no longer needed.

In particular:
The libsql directory contains code copied from the
libgda (http://www.gnome-db.org/) Gnome database system.
