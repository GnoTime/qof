                            ------------

This directory contains code that implements storage backends for QOF.
Although GnuCash has five storage backends, QOF only has two, 'dwi'
and 'QSF'. Each backend is under development.

For more information on DWI, see:
http://dwi.sourceforge.net/

For more information on QSF, see:
http://code.neil.williamsleesmill.me.uk/qsf.html

Future developments will include building a common SQL backend
using libgda that will provide pluggable access to any libgda
compatible database (currently including Oracle, Postgres, MySQL
SQLite and others). See http://www.gnome-db.org/
