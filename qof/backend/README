                            ------------

This directory contains code that implements storage backends for QOF.
Although GnuCash has five storage backends, QOF only has two, 'dwi'
and 'QSF'. Each backend is under development.

For more information on DWI, see:
http://dwi.sourceforge.net/

For more information on QSF, see:
http://code.neil.williamsleesmill.me.uk/qsf.html

Future developments will include building a common SQL backend
using libgda that will provide pluggable access to any libgda
compatible database (currently including Oracle, Postgres, MySQL
SQLite and others). See http://www.gnome-db.org/

Unfortunately, although work has begun to use libgda, the current
stable release does not support creating (or deleting) tables. The
module will be revisited when this support is complete. Note that
there are known API changes in libgda between the current stable
libgda2-3 1.2.3 release and the unstable/CVS code. These changes 
may become more noticeable in the period to the next stable
release.
