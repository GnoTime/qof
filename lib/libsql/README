                          ------

The contents of this directory contain the libsql SQL statement parser.
This has been copied, without modification, from the
gnomedb/libgda/libsql subdirectory on April 7th, 2004. 
(See http://www.gnome-db.org/)

None of the files indicate the provenance of this code, or the
applicable license; and the gnomedb folks don't seem to provide 
any clarifying remarks; however, gnomedb itself is under the GPL 
license and parts of it are under the less restrictive LGPL license.

I think I've seen this SQL parsing code before, I think its in the
public domain.  I think its two or three decades old.  Certainly, 
the pre-world-wide-web (pre-1994) alt.sources newsgroup contained 
a parser very similar to this; so did some late 1980's ftp sites.

I copied this code here because I did not want to make QOF dependent 
on the install of libgda or libsql.  If/when libsql is widely 
available and readily installed, then maybe we can remove this code.
In the meanwhile, this copy will stop "dependency hell".
